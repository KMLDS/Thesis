The method utilizes a fluid-filled prism and interferometric weak-value amplification to sense nanoradian deviations of a laser beam: due to the high thermo-optic coefficient of the fluid (colorless fluorocarbon), the deviation angle through the prism is sensitive to temperature. We estimate the daily stability of our device to be 0.2\&\#xA0;mK, which is limited by drifts in the apparatus, and the narrow 20\&\#xA0;mK capture range is the price paid for the weak measurement.},
